 * Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards.
Write a method isPalindrome thats accepts a String as a parameter and returns true if the String is a palindrome, false otherwise.
Stage 1 (simple)
Test your code with the following palindromes:
Navan
Madam
Noon
Civic
Radar
Level
Rats live on no evil star

Stage 2 (tricky)
Test your code (and adapt it if necessary) with all of the following palindromes:
Never odd or even
Mr. Owl ate my metal worm
A man, a plan, a canal – Panama
Madam, I'm Adam
Hint 1: Remember to break your code up into manageable methods which you can test independently
Hint 2: Try coding the solution both with and without the use of regular expressions.
