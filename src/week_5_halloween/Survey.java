/**
 * 
 * @author jacek; The Internet and the web are enabling more people to network,
 *         join a cause, voice opinions, and so on. Recent presidential
 *         candidates have used the Internet intensively to get out their
 *         messages and raise money for their campaigns. In this exercise,
 *         youâ€™ll write a simple polling program that allows users to rate
 *         five social-consciousness issues from 1 (least important) to 10 (most
 *         important). Pick five causes that are important to you (e.g.,
 *         political issues, global environmental issues). Use a one-dimensional
 *         array topics (of type String) to store the five causes. To summarize
 *         the survey responses, use a 5-row, 10-column two-dimensional array
 *         responses (of type int), each row corresponding to an element in the
 *         topics array. When the program runs, it should ask the user to rate
 *         each issue. Have your friends and family respond to the survey. Then
 *         have the program display a summary of the results, including:
 * 
 *         a) A tabular report with the five topics down the left side and the
 *         10 ratings across the top, listing in each column the number of
 *         ratings received for each topic.
 * 
 *         b) To the right of each row, show the average of the ratings for that
 *         issue.
 * 
 *         c) Which issue received the highest point total? Display both the
 *         issue and the point total.
 * 
 *         d) Which issue received the lowest point total? Display both the
 *         issue and the point total.
